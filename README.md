## Initallation Instructions
Our app is to be run on your local machine so do the following:
1. Clone this repo (from main) in your preferred method
2. Navigate to the root directory of this repo
3. In your terminal run "bash _scripts/startDev.sh" (give it a few mins to install dependencies)
4. Once ready navigate to localhost:8080 to view the clientside and localhost:3000 to view the API.
5. When restarting or stopping, we advice you teardown using "bash _scripts/teardown.sh"

## What to play around with:
Try the following:
- Play around with adding your own thoughts about code or anything.
- We have 3 pre-made posts, to navigate to them use their ID which will be 1, 2 or 3 as so: "localhost:8080/#2" (make sure you include the #)
- Try navigating to a post ID that does not exist, try: "localhost:8080/#10"

## Testing
Coming soon.
